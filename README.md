**Installation**

Firstly install python modules
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Secondly navigate to "vbms-frontend" directory
```
cd ./vbms-frontend
```
Then install all node modules
```
npm i
```
<hr/>

**Running**

Windows 
```
./run.ps1
```
Linux
```
./run.sh
```
**Technical Details**

The backend uses ```flask``` to create an api which interacts with database with a postGres connector called ```psycopg2```.
The backend also has a class called volleyBallData which contains many of the methods neccesary to interact with the database.

The frontend is made with _React_ and will send requests to the backend to serve data to users. 

The interface also allows users to interface with the database at a level determined by their role on the team. For example every user can change 
their shirt size, phone number and commuter status but not all users can edit/create games.

<h4>Data Sources</h4>

<h6>Faker Library:</h6>
Usage: Faker is a Python library used extensively in this project to create data that resembles real-world information.
Data Types Generated:
Personal Information: Names, emails, and phone numbers for users (players, coaches, admins).
Temporal Data: Dates and times for games, practices, and announcements.
Location Data: Addresses and locations for game and practice venues.

<h6>Custom Python Scripts:</h6>
Functionality: These scripts are tailored to the specific needs of the VBMS. They utilize Faker for basic data generation and add custom logic to create volleyball-specific information.
Key Features:
Team Data Generation: Scripts generate team names, player roles, and coach assignments.
Game and Practice Schedules: Automated creation of game and practice schedules, ensuring no conflicts or unrealistic timings.
Injury Reports and Transfers: Generation of realistic injury reports and player transfer data between teams.

<h6> Admin-Defined Data:</h6>
Nature: This dataset comprises manually entered data that provides a base for the VBMS. It includes information that requires domain knowledge and specificity, which cannot be effectively generated by automated scripts.
Components:
Team and Tournament Names: Predefined names for teams and tournaments to add authenticity to the simulated environment.
Specific Event Details: Manual entry of special events, such as end-of-season galas or charity matches, that require unique descriptions and details.
Tailored Announcements: Custom announcements related to team activities, achievements, or specific messages from coaches and administrators.

<h6>Database Integration:</h6>
PostgreSQL Database: The backend of VBMS is powered by a PostgreSQL database. The data generated through the above methods is formatted and structured for compatibility with this database system.
Data Structuring: The structured data from various sources is organized into a format that aligns with the database schema of VBMS, ensuring seamless integration and retrieval.

<h6>Usage and Future Work</h6>
Data Integration: The CSV files are designed for easy import into the VBMS's PostgreSQL database.
Testing and Simulation: Data can be used for system testing, user training, and simulating real-world scenarios in volleyball team management.
Extensibility: The structured data format and comprehensive documentation make it easy to extend or modify data for future enhancements or new features in the VBMS.
